selection sort-
selection sort is a sorting algorithm in which the first minimum element is found in an array and it is swapped with the first element in the array.Then the second minimum element is found which is swapped with 2nd element.This process repeats until the array is sorted.

insertion sort-
insertion sort is a sorting technique in which the array is divided into two parts sorted and unsorted,the first element is added to the sorted part and the loop runs from 2nd element and checks if it is smaller to or greater than the first element and adds the element at its currect position increasing the sorted part.If a element is smaller it is added at the front and if an element is larger then loops until the element larger than the second element is found and adds the element,swapping all elements to right and thus,increasing the sorted the part

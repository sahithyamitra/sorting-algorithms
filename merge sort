merge sort

idea:->Its a divide and conquer algorithm
->Best case and worst case Time complexity:O(n*logn)
->auxillary space:O(n)
->Stable algorithm:The sequence of equal elements remains the same after sorting
->well suited for linked lists where it works in O(1) auxillary space
->whereas for arrays,quicksort outperforms merge sort
->used in external sorting technique.
